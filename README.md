The datasets used in our experiments are derived from [KVASIR](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/francismon/curated-colon-dataset-for-deep-learning) and [KVASIR-v2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/plhalvorsen/kvasir-v2-a-gastrointestinal-tract-dataset).

The checkpoint of our proposed model can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NZ9pkbq-4P_5573sckH-wF5VtIR1-CNC/view?usp=sharing).
